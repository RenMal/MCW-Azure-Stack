# Azure Stack

Contoso Finance LLC is one of the largest banks in the United States with a significant amount of their revenue coming from their residential mortgage business. As part of Contoso's shift to a cloud first strategy they planning to migrate their loan web applications to a hybrid cloud solution. During the planning stages, Contoso realized they would not be able to retain their customer data in US based Azure regions due to corporate compliance policies and regulatory issues. They have selected Azure Stack as the deployment method to take advantage of Azure technologies while still maintaining compliance.

## Abstract 

### Workshop

In this fun workshop, you will learn how to design a hybrid cloud architecture using a combination of the Azure public cloud and Azure Stack. This functional architecture will enable customers to leverage their investments in Azure as a "cloud platform," rather than Azure as a "place." You will learn to determine which systems are good candidates for the Azure public cloud and which are better suited on Azure Stack.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to recommend and design hybrid cloud systems that leverage one application and deployment model, Azure.

In addition, you will learn to understand when the Azure public cloud versus Azure Stack is appropriate based on customer requirements, describe possible integrations between Azure public cloud solutions and Azure Stack, understand the taxonomy of Azure Stack (tenants, regions, subscriptions, offers, plans, services and quotas), describe the resource providers that are available for use with Azure Stack, and design and deploy hybrid connectivity between Azure public cloud and Azure Stack.

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work with a group to design a hybrid cloud architecture using a combination of the Azure public cloud and Azure Stack. This functional architecture will enable customers to leverage their investments in Azure as a "cloud platform," rather than Azure as a "place."

At the end of the session, you will be able to determine which systems are good candidates for the Azure public cloud, and which are better suited on Azure Stack.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy the Azure Stack Development Kit and deploy the SQL Database and Azure App Service resource providers, as well as download several virtual machine images from the Azure Stack Marketplace. From there, you will implement a full taxonomy in Azure Stack consisting of a region, subscription, plan, offer, and quotas. After Azure Stack is configured, you will then deploy Azure SQL Database, Web and API apps and then deploy the Contoso application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to deploy and manage solutions running on Azure Stack.
